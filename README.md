# Egham JavaScript Meetup

This is a group for people doing serious stuff with JavaScript and NodeJS. If you are building rich applications, providing open-source contributions, looking forward to ES7, or crafting cool code, you'll find people to share your experiences with. If you are just starting out, come and meet others who have been there. This is a place to share knowledge, ask questions, learn and grumble; and an opportunity to prove that the best developers arenâ€™t just in London. We meet monthly in Egham, Surrey for some informal talks, live coding, show-and-tell, questions and of course beer. Sign up and join us!
